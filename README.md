# advent-of-code-2022

## Welcome!

Here are my solutions for the advent of code 2022 problems.
I wanted to try out python this year, and I must say, it is nice :)
Just a couple things to note:

- inputs has the input.txt files
- problems has the detailed problem statements
- format for files: d1-p1 = day one part one, etc.
- some problems may have multiple answers--the typically labeled one is how I did it the quickest/on first try, and the extra credit is when I went back later and optimized it

Enjoy :)
